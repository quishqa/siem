# Overview

This the SImplied Emission Model (SIEM).
It is a python package to create the emission file for [WRF-Chem](https://www2.acom.ucar.edu/wrf-chem) and [CMAQ](https://www.epa.gov/cmaq) air quality models.

It is inspired in the works of [Andrade et al. (2015)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-science/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2015.00009/full),
[AAS4WRF](https://github.com/alvv1986/AAS4WRF), [PyChEmiss](https://github.com/quishqa/PyChEmiss).

This documentation used the [diaxtasis](https://diataxis.fr/) approach.
It is structured as follows:

1. [Explanation](explanation.md): The motivation to create this package.
2. [Tutorial](tutorials.md): Example to start creating your emissions.
3. [How to guides](how-to-guides.md): Examples in more detailed about specific tasks.
4. [Reference](reference.md): A guide of the classes and functions of the package.
